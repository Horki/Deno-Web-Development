# The book

This book targets developers who want to leverage their JavaScript and TypeScript skills in a secure, simple and modern runtime, using it for web development. Node.js knowledge is not required but recommended.

## Deno

Deno is a modern and secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime that evolved from Node.js. It deeply leverages features of modern JavaScript, adding a secure by default layer and shipping the complete toolset in the runtime binary.

“Getting started with Deno” is the book that will introduce Deno’s primitives and explain how developers can use them to build real-word applications. The book starts by explaining the reason for Deno’s existence. It looks at Node.js, recognizing all its merits and understanding why it took the world by storm. Then, it explains the creation of Deno in today’s world, with modern JavaScript and a new set of needs that developers have, among them the need for a security model and decentralized dependency management, both inexistent in Node. After being introduced to the motivations, the reader will get comfortable with the environment, exploring Deno’s ecosystem and toolchain. The book will introduce all of this while writing simple CLI applications, demonstrating Deno APIs and standard-modules. As the chapters proceed, the reader will be guided through the process of building a complete API with Deno.

By the end of the book, the author will be comfortable using Deno to create and maintain secure and reliable applications.
